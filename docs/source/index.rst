Welcome to ProcDocs Documentation!
====================================================
ProcDocs is a lightweight framework for authoring, validating, and rendering structured documents such as test procedures and work instructions. 
It separates document structure (schema), content (document), and presentation (formatting) to support modularity, reuse, and robust validation. 
Ideal for teams building high-integrity systems, ProcDocs brings clarity and consistency to your manual documentation and certification workflows.
